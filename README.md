# Book-List
A simple web application which uses PostgreSQL and a Express server to showcase the details of the books that we have read.
1. Create a database on PostgreSQL named 'bookreview'.
2. Follow the directions given in queries.sql to create and store the details of the books in the database.
3. Inside index.js type in the password to your database user in the part where a new client is created.
4. Open the terminal and type 'npm i' to install all the required dependencies.
5. Type 'node index.js' to run the server on localhost.
